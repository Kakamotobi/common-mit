## File System

> In computing, a **file system** or **filesystem** (often abbreviated to **fs**) is a method and data structure that the operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved. | Wikipedia

- A filesystem is needed to avoid storing everything as one large body of data, which means we cannot _determine where one data piece of data starts and stops_.
- Through the file system, every data is separated and given a name, which makes it possible to identify that data/file.
- File Systems are used in HDs, SSDs, etc.
- RAM uses a temporary file system (since it is volatile memory).
